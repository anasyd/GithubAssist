### Basic Workflow

2. **Click "Resolve conflicts"** to enter GitHub's conflict editor
3. **Extension buttons appear** above the editor showing branch names
4. **Choose your resolution strategy:**
   - **Accept All Current** (`your-branch-name`) - Keep your changes
   - **Accept All Incoming** (`main`) - Accept incoming changes
   - **Keep Both** - Preserve both versions
5. **Content is auto-copied** - just paste with `Ctrl+V`
6. **Complete the resolution** by clicking GitHub's "Mark as resolved"

### Button Guide

| Button | Action | When to Use |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `Accept All Current` | Keep your branch's changes | Your code is correct/preferred |
| `Accept All Incoming` | Accept the other branch's changes | Their code is better/newer |
| `Keep Both` | Preserve both sets of changes | Both changes are needed |
| `Show Resolved` | Display the resolved content | Review before pasting |

### Visual Indicators

- **Green button**: Accept current branch changes
- **Blue button**: Accept incoming branch changes  
- **Purple button**: Keep both sets of changes
- **Yellow button**: Show resolved content for review
- **Branch names** appear below buttons for clarity

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Appearing

- **Check you're on a conflict page**: Extension only activates on GitHub conflict resolution pages
- **Refresh the page**: Try reloading the GitHub page
- **Check extension is enabled**: Visit `chrome://extensions/` and ensure it's enabled
- **Look for errors**: Open Developer Tools (F12) and check for error messages

### Copy/Paste Issues

- **Manual copy option**: Use the "Show Resolved" button if auto-copy fails
- **Browser permissions**: Some browsers may block clipboard access
- **Alternative method**: Select and copy the resolved content manually

### Content Not Updating

- **Use copy-paste workflow**: The extension doesn't directly modify GitHub's editor
- **Follow the steps**: Copy resolved content ‚Üí Select all in editor ‚Üí Paste
- **GitHub's "Mark as resolved"**: Always click this after pasting

### Branch Names Not Showing

- **Generic names displayed**: Shows "current" and "incoming" if detection fails
- **Still functional**: Extension works even without specific branch names
- **Check conflict markers**: Branch names are extracted from `<<<<<<< branch-name`

## Browser Compatibility

- ‚úÖ **Chrome** (Recommended)
- ‚úÖ **Microsoft Edge** (Chromium-based)
- ‚úÖ **Brave Browser**
- ‚úÖ **Other Chromium browsers**
- ‚ùå **Firefox** (Not compatible - uses different extension format)
- ‚ùå **Safari** (Not compatible)

## Privacy & Security

- üîí **No data collection** - Extension operates entirely locally
- üö´ **No external requests** - Only reads from GitHub pages you visit
- üè† **Local processing** - All conflict resolution happens in your browser
- üîê **No permissions abuse** - Only requests necessary `activeTab` access
- üìù **Open source** - All code is available for review
